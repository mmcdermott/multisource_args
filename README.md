# multisource_args
A simple utility for maintaining arguments that can be used across multiple interfaces (predominately CLI and Jupyter Notebooks) and making reading and writing arguments to files default. This is based on something I've used in a few projects and is naturally therefore primarily built with ML research applications in mind, and arguments will assume that they are instantiated with a "run directory" in mind which is intended to be the _sole_ directory corresponding to a particular run of the model or instantiation of a dataset/cached dataset. If such a solution to this problem / similar utility already exists and is better than this, please let me know (via a github issue).
